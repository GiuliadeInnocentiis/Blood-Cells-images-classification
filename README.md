# Blood-Cells-images-classification
The use of statistical learning is growing in medicine as a diagnostic support tool. This work focuses on classifying white blood cells—key for early diagnosis of leukemia and other diseases—using convolutional neural networks, with and without transfer learning. Conformal prediction was applied to estimate class uncertainty.
